    <hr>
    <p class="para1">Once a product is developed and introduced to the public, the job does not end there. It is commonly observed that the company would take surveys, use feedback forms and continuously try to improve their services and products, even mid-production, by adding or removing features. The question arises: <b><i>“Why does the company feel the need to do this once their product has been designed and published?”</i></b>
        <br><br>The answer is simple. <br><br>
        <b><i>To cater to the users’ needs and improve products to come as they discover what works and what does not.</i></b><br><br>
        Same is the case with any piece of technology, whether it be an app, a website, a machine, a personal computer system etc.<br><br>
        The aspects of Human Computer Interaction are discussed as under:

        </ul>
        <h3 id ="section1">What is Human Computer Interaction?</h3>
        <p class = "para1">When the computer was first introduced, it was supposed to be a machine for humans by humans. Read the last phrase again. <b><i>For humans, by humans. </i></b>“Interaction” simply is defined as an action between two or more parties which influences both of the parties. <b>Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a study of how interaction takes place between a machine or system (term loosely used here as many other tech pieces and the overall production process is involved in HCI) and humans and how it can be improved.</b> Human Computer Interaction is a field of study which combines many other fields of study such as design, computer science, cognitive science and human factors engineering. Sounds confusing? Don’t worry. These terms will be explained in a little bit.</p>
        <p class="para1">Consider a situation where a fight breaks out between two people. How does one make them reconcile? Of course, one would try to understand both parties. Same is the case in Human Computer Interaction; in order to understand how to improve the way information is exchanged between the user and the tech specimen, it is essential to understand both <b>how a computer/system works</b> and <b>how a user responds.</b> <a class ="figlink" href = "#list1">Back to contents.</a></p>

        <h3 id ="section2">Important terms related to HCI</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Design</b><br><p class="para2">This is a pretty simple term. Design refers to figuring out strategies and using them in one’s project.</p></li>
            <li><b>Computer science</b><p class="para2">Again, not a very difficult term to understand. It involves the field of computing and essentially is a study of what the computer is and how it works. It has many domains such as web engineering, artificial intelligence, networks etc.</p></li>
            <li><b>Cognitive science</b><p class = "para2">Cognition refers to the process of the brain trying to understand something and how it responds. This is the core concept used in cognitive science, the application of which is observing, studying and even predicting user responses.</p></li>
            <li><b>Human factors engineering</b><p class = "para2">This is also referred to as “ergonomics” or “human engineering”. It involves the study of how things can be made easier for other people and factors are studied to improve the performance of the system involved.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "para2">Definitions may vary but these are the core concepts implemented in Human Computer Interaction. <a class ="figlink" href = "#list2">Back to contents.</a></p>
        <h3 id ="section3">What is the ultimate goal of this study?</h3>
        <p class="para1">The ultimate objective of this field is to <b>minimize user effort</b> and <b>improve system efficiency and usability</b> and overall improve system interface and experience. The goal is to create a system which can <b>fit in naturally</b> (or with the <b>least amount of effort on the user’s part</b>) with the user, instead of the user learning new mechanics altogether, thus, guaranteeing user satisfaction.</p>
        <p class="para1"><b>Usability</b> is the core of Human Computer Interaction. It is referred to as the property of a design which leads to the user achieving their desired goal by completing a task or a series of tasks in an effective and satisfying way.<br><br>The two main slogans associated with HCI are:</p>
        <p class="para3">"Easy to learn, easy to use."</p>
        <p class = "para2">And:</p>
        <p class="para3">"People come first.”</p>
        <p><a class ="figlink" href = "#list3">Back to contents.</a></p>
        <h3 id ="section4">Examples of Human Computer Interaction</h3>
        <p class="para1">Now after having tackled the disciplines involved and the goal of HCI, let us give a few examples to make it even clearer what Human Computer Interaction involves:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p class= "para2">To cater to blind users or to simply reduce typing effort, Voice Recognition/Input features were introduced in search engines. This led to the development of <b><i>Cortana</i></b> in Microsoft Windows, <b><i>Siri</i></b> in Apple, <b><i>Alexa</i></b> in Amazon, aka virtual assistants.</p></li>
            <li><p class= "para2"><b>Placing of buttons</b> in certain places and choosing <b>certain colours</b> according to redundant response by users in phone apps (red associated with negative options like “No” or “Cancel” and green usually associated with positive options like “Yes” or “Agree”. These conventions were developed naturally over the course of system design and are often instinctive on the user’s part. An example would be the Twitter retweet button which in 2020 changed positions from its usual space and was something disliked by many Twitter fans. The change was reverted in the latter part of 2020.</p></li>
            <li><p class= "para2">The <b><i>QWERTY</i> keyboard layout</b> was essentially first introduced to deliberately place letters commonly used together further apart from each other. The reason was to prevent the person typing from pressing more than one key at the same time because of this kind of proximity. The creator of this layout, Christopher Latham Sholes, an American inventor, learnt from his experience of using a typewriter and created this layout to overcome the hurdles caused by the typewriter.</p></li>
            <li><p class= "para2"><b>GUI’s</b> (Graphical User Interfaces) like later versions of Microsoft Windows were developed to rid the user of tediously learning commands in the text based format of Command Line Interface.</p></li>

        <h3 id ="section6">Origin of HCI</h3>
        <p class="para1">The concept of HCI was not really an invention but more of a collective and gradually felt need by the end of the 1970s in order to improve system design for the sake of users’ convenience. The term itself, however, was coined in the 1980s and was first used by the authors and computer researchers Allen Newell, Stuart K. Card and Thomas P. Moran. Their book was titled <i>“The Psychology of Human–Computer Interaction”</i> and focused on studying the behaviour of people during their interaction with computer systems. <a class ="figlink" href = "#list6">Back to contents.</a></p>
        <h3 id ="section7">Process of HCI</h3>
        <p class="para1">The process of HCI largely varies however, the following guidelines are commonly observed:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Requirement identification</b><br><p class="para2">This is the first step where if something is amiss in a system and the need to improve it is felt or some problem is identified during analysis. User information is considered such as number of users, target audience, intended tasks by the user etc.</p></li>
            <li><b>Empirical measurement</b><br><p class="para2">To test performance, to analyze to have further and concrete user information, the existing interface is tested with the help of actual users. In this way, valuable information can be obtained and one can move on to building the new design.</p></li>
            <li><b>Building an alternative to an existing design</b><br><p class="para2">This is the process of suggesting and building a “fixed” design to counter the problem faced. More than one solutions may be presented.</p></li>
            <li><b>Development of an interactive version of the design adopted</b><br><p class="para2">Once a design is approved, best possible interactivity options are included to yield maximum productive feedback to further improve if needed.</p></li>
            <li><b>Design evaluation</b><br><p class="para2">Feedback is an essential part of HCI as it is the best medium of further identification of problems. The design is further analyzed for the sake of evaluation. Steps 3, 4 and 5 are part of the iterative design process.</p></li>
            <li><b>Display Design Principles</b><br><p class="para2">There are four types of principles within which display design, that is, how information is presented to the user, is done:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Perceptual principles </b><p class="para2">Setting the way information is perceived by the user such as legibility or audibility, feature highlighting, repetition and to subtly enforce user understanding</p></li>
                <li><b>Mental model principles </b><p class="para2">Usage of accurate models, loyal to user expectations, for example, accurate pictorial and animation representation</p></li>
                <li><b>Attention principles </b><p class="para2">Access to resources, linking and visual proximity of relevant elements. In <i>"Designing with the Mind in Mind”</i> by Jeff Johnson, the author points out how users will most often go for a target oriented experience, in other words, they want direct and quick access to the resource that they want and often will not only ignore everything else but will not even see it in the first place! This makes it important to place the frequently accessed elements in a place where the user has been programmed to look for instinctively.</p></li>
                <li><b>Memory principles </b><p class="para2">Minimizing user effort by taking advantage of classic design conventions which will call for an instinctive response by the user</p></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><a class ="figlink" href = "#list7">Back to contents.</a></p>
        <h3 id ="section8">Clearing up the ambiguity between UX, UI and HCI</h3>
        <p class= "para1">The terms Human Computer Interaction (HCI), User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are often confused with each other so it is important to clear up the difference and similarities that these terms involve.</p>
        <p class= "para1">Human Computer Interaction can simply be referred to as the <b>predecessor of User Experience</b>. It is a more academics-oriented domain whereas <b>User Experience</b> is a <b>modern and industrial application of HCI</b>. It includes the <b>practicality aspects of a product</b> such as customization and various features as well as <b>what a user gets to take away from it</b>. A point to be noted is that User Experience is not limited to tech products only. It is a concept utilized in every industry, however when this term comes up, the first domain that usually comes to mind is web designing. Under the application of HCI, here is a comparison of good and bad UX which challenges user experience conventions.</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="outlineimg" src="6 UX UI HCI.png"></img>
            <figcaption><a class ="figlink"href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/good-bad-ux-design-examples/">From Adobe XD</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class= "para1">It is quite obvious to see that the image on the left will be preferred and will be easier to understand for the user as it involves all the key visual components such as colour and size in the correct hierarchical way, making it easier to distinguish between all elements. </p>
        <p class= "para1">Another example of UX can be the design of a screwdriver, how it has a certain design so that the user can grip the tool easily, however, this deviates a bit from HCI and has been mentioned only for the sake of clarity.</p>
        <p class= "para1">The usual model used for UX known as the <b>“UX Honeycomb”</b> is also depicted underneath, which defines the criteria for effective UX.</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="contentimg" src="8 UX_Honeycomb.png"></img>
            <figcaption><a class ="figlink"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">From interaction-design.org</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class= "para1"><b>User interface</b>, on the other hand, is an existing concept under HCI and is yet another industrial application of HCI which is of utmost importance. It is the medium between the user and the computer system through which not only the computer displays information but the user also perceives this information and interacts with the system. <a class ="figlink" href = "#list8">Back to contents.</a></p>
        <h3 id ="section9">Current research</h3>
        <p class= "para1">Many exciting projects are underway to enhance system efficiency and proficiency such as <b>image processing efficiency</b>, increasing <b>system portability</b>, improving <b>ubiquitous computing</b> (availability of computing anywhere) and if you are interested, you may visit websites like <a class = "links" href = "https://hci.epfl.ch/category/students-page/student-project-ideas"title="Visit HCI Group!">Human Computer Interaction Group</a> and <a class="links" href ="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/research/faculty/grid"title="Visit faculty projects!">Human Computer Interaction Institute</a> to view student-faculty projects in this domain to further understand what is to possibly come. Furthermore, <b>organizations</b> exist to support HCI and present research work such as the <b>ACM-CHI</b> (Association of Computing and Machinery Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems) and the <b>HCII</b> (Human–Computer Interaction International). </p>
        <p class= "para1">An example research work was presented in CHI 2019 by César A. Collazos, Andrés F. Solano, Sandra Patricia Cano and Leandro Flórez-Aristizábal titled <b><i>DesignABILITY</i></b>, which consisted of guidelines for <b>development of technology for teaching children with disabilities</b>. <a class ="figlink" href = "#list9">Back to contents.</a></p>
        <h3 id ="section10">Importance of Human Computer Interaction</h3>
        <p class= "para1">HCI helps one to <b>set goals</b> along the way and makes one address the smallest and most significance of <b>details</b> which ends up in the best user experience. Because there are many similar products out there but good HCI makes all the difference when it comes to preference. On the non-profit side, HCI’s most significant role is <b>catering to users with disabilities</b> and their study is essential in order to produce optimum products for their use. Good HCI is the reason why technology becomes more mainstream and its use becomes <b>intuitive</b> and easy to learn and remember. <a class ="figlink" href = "#list10">Back to contents.</a></p>
